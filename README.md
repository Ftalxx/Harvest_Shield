# Disease Identification And Prevention

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>
<br>
Our application aims to revolutionize agriculture by providing an advanced solution for predicting, classifying, and recommending remediation strategies for various crop diseases and pest infestations. This tool is designed to be an all-in-one platform that leverages machine learning, data scraping, and a user-friendly interface to assist farmers and agricultural experts in making informed decisions.

<summary>Key Features</summary>

- **Camera Identification (VGG16)**: Utilize your device's camera to capture images of crops, pests, and diseases. Our VGG16-based model accurately detects and classifies these issues.

- **CNN Model to Recognize Pests**: Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is specifically trained to recognize various pests, providing accurate identification and classification.

- **Remediation and Prevention**: LLM model that provides practical advice and solutions based on the prediction model and risk analysis, including recommendations for partner solutions such as pesticides tailored to your crops' needs.

- **Dataset Development**: We scraped data from Integrated Pest Management (IPM) URLs and Wikipedia, compiling a dataset with up to 160,000 rows of functional text information to enhance the accuracy of our predictions.

- **Geographical Interface with Mapping API**: The app documents land, pest, disease, and crop data, providing a visual representation through an easy-to-use geographical interface. This helps users track and manage their agricultural portfolio effectively.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with ease of access in mind, our interface integrates geographical data seamlessly to provide an intuitive user experience.
